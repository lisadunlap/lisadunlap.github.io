        <h1>Me in a Nutshell</h1>
        <p>Hello again, just in case you forgot my name is Lisa Dunlap, it's nice to meet you.</p>
        <p>I am currently a Sophomore at UC Berkeley studying computer science and mathematics. As of the moment I am on track to graduate a year early but it's still up in the air as to whether that is going to happen.</p>
        <p>Last year I deviated from computer science and worked with a biological analyst at Kansas University on two research projectts involving the movement ecology of lizards on Cabo, Mexico and Colorado Springs. This year I have been working at RISE Lab at UC Berkeley on Computer Vision and Machine Learning (for more specifics in the Projects tab), but I hope to get involoved in areas of computer architecture in the near future. I have a strong background in mathematics, specifically linear algebra, and I would consider myself a professional Googler.</p>
        <h3>Some Personal Info</h3>
        <p>Although I live in California now, I grew up in Austin Texas and stand firm in the fact that it is the best state that has ever and will ever exist. I am an exercise addict and a health freak, so most of my free time is spent either at the gym or cooking too many vegitables.</p>
